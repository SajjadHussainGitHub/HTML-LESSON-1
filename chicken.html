    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    <p>
      The
      <b>chicken</b>
      (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red
      junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term
      for an adult male bird, and younger male may be called a cockerel. A male
      that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen
      and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young,
      bird.[when?] However, thanks to its usage on restaurant menus, it has now
      become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in
      American English. In older sources, 'chicken' as a species were typically
      referred to as 'common fowl' or 'domestic fowl'.[20] 'Chicken' may also
      mean a 'chick' (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[21]

    <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
    <p>
      Chickens are omnivores.[25] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to
      search for seeds, insects and even animals as large as lizards, small
      snakes,[26] or young mice.[27] The average chicken may live for 5-10
      years, depending on the breed.[28] The world's oldest known chicken was a
      hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the
      Guinness World Records.[29]
