    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    <p>
      The
      <b>chicken</b>
      (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red
      junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term
      for an adult male bird, and younger male may be called a cockerel. A male
      that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen
      and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young,
      bird.[when?] However, thanks to its usage on restaurant menus, it has now
      become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in
      American English. In older sources, 'chicken' as a species were typically
      referred to as 'common fowl' or 'domestic fowl'.[20] 'Chicken' may also
      mean a 'chick' (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[21]

    <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
    <p>
      Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a
      communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young.
      Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a
      "pecking order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access
      and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a
      temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is
      established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock
      can lead to fighting and injury.[30] When a rooster finds food, he may
      call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch
      as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be
      observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat. A
      rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a
      territorial signal to other roosters.[31] However, roosters may also crow
      in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck
      loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also
      give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from
      the air or on the ground.[32]
